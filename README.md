# GetWeather
This program gets the weather from https://weatherapi.com/
site and enters the temperature in Celsius in the weather.txt file.

weatherapi.com only allows you to send requests to its API 1 million times a month for free. 
Therefore, the program receives currency values every 10 minutes.
